Just answers to questions, big and easy to read. No non-sense, no bullshit.

## Motivation

When I look for answers on the internet, most of the time,
what I want comes with tons of introductory, explanatory,
and a lot of other filler text.

All I wanted was a quick reference, with these characteristics:

1. First, and foremost, an answer
2. Subsequent information more than prerequisites
3. Most common alternatives
4. Little to no explanation
5. Only relevant references
6. No scroll bars

So, this is basically describing a cheat-sheet,
that follows a common workflow.
That's what this repository is all about.

### 1. First, and foremost, an answer

Of course the question title comes before the answer, but that is it.
Everything that is not the main answer to the problem must go after that.

### 2. Subsequent information more than prerequisites

Most texts on the internet have introductions and explanations before an answer.
What I want is the opposite: an answer, and what are the probable next steps.

In no way prerequisites are to be excluded,
but I assume prior knowledge from the reader.

Subsequent and prerequisites can be presented directly, or as links.

### 3. Most common alternatives

Incomplete questions have multiple answers.
In this case, the most mainstream answer comes first.
Other answers are added after that, directly or as links.

### 4. Little to no explanation

I assume the reader to have prior knowledge,
at least one level below from what is being answered.
That why little explanation is needed,
sometimes the answer is self-explanatory for someone
one level below. Sometimes matters are a bit hideous
and the reader just needs that extra bit of info
to clear everything out.

### 5. Only relevant references

I really don't want to waste space, and references are
the kind of thing that is used as a last resort.
If references are to be included, they'd better be
some great learning material, or the source documentation
for completeness.

### 6. No scroll bars

I want everything of the greatest relevance
for the matter to fit in a screen.
It's all about focus and priority.
